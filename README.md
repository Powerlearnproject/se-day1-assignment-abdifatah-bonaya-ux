# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems.
- it enables the creation of software applications and systems that powers various aspects of modern life.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- development of programming languages
- establishment of software engineering as a discipline
- the rise of agile methodologies


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirements - gathering and documentation of user needs and system requirements
-design - creating a detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface
-implementation - writing codes and building software according to design specifications
-testing - it ensures software meets quality standards and functional requirements
-maintenance - providing ongoing support,updates to the software after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- in comparison both are software development methodologies, in waterfall, we approach it in a sequential manner with distinct phases while in agile, we approach in an iterative and incremental manner focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.
- example of waterfall is like construction of building
- example of agile is extreme programming which puts emphasy on testing and continous integration.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- software developer - writing codes and implementation of software solutions.
- quality assurance engineer- ensures software quality
- project manager - oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- IDEs - it provides comprehensive tools for writing, debugging and testing code eg. Eclipse
- VCSs - it tracks changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg. Git


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Tight deadlines - we shall overcome by giving out a clear scope during analysis period
- changing requirements - give room for adjustment during designing
- technical debts - by prioritizing tasks 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing - testing individual components or modules of software
- integration testing - testing interactions between different components or subsystems
- System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole
- Acceptance testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Prompt Engineering is crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models
- it helps in making questions clear and specific thus avoiding confusing answers

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-Example of vague question importance of software development.
-improved version, "importance of software development in relation to real life" 
-it is important coz it gives a precise answer and not general answer
